# Fibonacci

In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation: Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 with seed values and F0 = 0 and F1 = 1 .
Create a smart contract as follows which calculates the value of Fn in the fibonacci sequence:

 

function fibonacci(uint n) public returns (uint): This function should take 1 parameter of type uint256, n, as input and output the value of Fn in the fibonacci sequence as described above.
